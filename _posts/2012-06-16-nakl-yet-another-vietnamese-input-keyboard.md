I&#8217;m happy to announce that the first version of NAKL &#8211; my open source Vietnamese input keyboard &#8211; had been released yesterday.

NAKL&#8217;s engine is based on XVNKB, a well-known Vietnamese input keyboard on Linux. The source code is hosted on Github and licensed under GPL version 3.0.
