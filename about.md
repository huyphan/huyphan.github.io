### me.iam

I build things at work and break stuff at night. I was born in [one of the happiest countries in the world](https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/non-economic-data/happiest-countries) but later relocated to Singapore and am now living in Sydney where I work for Amazon InfoSec team. 

I wrote [NAKL](http://huyphan.github.io/NAKL/index_en.html), a light-weight and open-source Vietnamese keyboard for Mac. I'm also spending time contributing to [open-source projects](https://github.com/huyphan?tab=repositories) and reasearching computer security.
